# CourseWork3Year
This project was created for Course Work in the 3rd year of study at the university.

The topic of my Course Work "Analysis and search for a niche for brand promotion in social networks" using Web Scraping technology. 
I have chosen the top 3 popular platforms, such as Instagram, Youtube and TikTok to collect data from official web resources and save them in Excel, CSV ot Text file.

If we speak about instruments, that I used, here is main ones:
1. Pandas
2. MySQL
3. Tkinter 
4. Requests
5. Lxml
6. Xlrd

In result, the desktop app with simple UI design was made to collect data for stock analysis and band promotion.
